I am creating a Webcafe AI Landing page, using Visual Studio Code on macOS, primarily with React for the frontend and Firebase as the backend. The primary goal is to make an optimized landing page. My coding style preferences remain the same, with parentheses around parameters in arrow functions and minimal spaces inside object braces. The project directory is C:\Users\robho\code\construct-public. My GitHub username is monster3230.
